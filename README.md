# Complete Cloud Infrastructure with Generative AI
This repository is from AWS Solutions Architect CloudQuest. This solution demonstrates the speed up adoption of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to deploy applications and infrastructure in a repeatable manner.

This is the diagram of this lab:

To have in mind ***both AWS CDK and CodeWhisperer are integrated directly to AWS Cloud9***

ðŸ’¡ In this lab, when CDK is written, CodeWhisperer will provide suggestions based on comments and the context of the existing code.

Finally, when the code is ***completed*** and ***tested***, it synthesized into a AWS CloudFormation template, which ***deploys*** the resources and applications that were defined in the CDK code.

> [!TIP]
> Build the template in the next order:

1. In the Cloud9 environment, create a folder for the CDK App.
   
3. Create a virtual environment using = python3.8 -m venv .venv (in case you want to delete the venv created use = rm -rf .venv)
   
5. Activate the venv created using = source .venv/bin/activate
   
7. Create a txt file for the libraries required (aws-cdk library). Which are the mentioned below:
   
    aws-cdk-lib=2.137.0
    constructs>=10.0.0,<11.0.0
9. Install the requirements.txt
